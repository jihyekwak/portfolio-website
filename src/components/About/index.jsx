        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Jihye Kwak, a full stack developer based in San Francisco Bay Area. I recently completed the 24-week full-stack web development immersive program by General Assembly. Learnings include in-demand modern programming technologies, fundamental computer science knowledge, and multilateral teamwork environment. I realized how much I enjoy learning new languages, applying it to a visible format, creating different web services, and understanding the hidden details of the websites I use. </p>
